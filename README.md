This is the incomplete spirtual successor to the incomplete scheduling mechanism in an earlier project: [Bread Scheduler](https://github.com/michaelporter/Bread_Schedule).  Just for kicks I plotted the bread-making steps on a graph with weighted directional edges.  In theory, the decision of which step to take next on which bread can be deduced by using this edge information, but really I just need to spend more time with this.
